### Reading:

[AWS Architecture Blog - Compute Abstractions on AWS: A Visual Story](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/architecture/compute-abstractions-on-aws-a-visual-story/)

### Prompts:

1. Explain the levels of abstraction in AWS to someone without a technical background.
   *
2. What are the control plane and data plane responsible for in container abstraction?
   *
3. Where does AWS Lambda fall in the layers of abstraction and what makes it so special?
   *
